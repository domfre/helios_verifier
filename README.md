# Helios Verifier

This repository provides an application for a full verification of an election and its components conducted by the 
[Helios Voting System](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/)
or any equivalent voting system respecting the guidelines defined by the official 
[Helios v4 specs](https://documentation.heliosvoting.org/verification-specs/helios-v4) regarding the data formats 
and verification protocols. <br>

The [Helios v4 specs](https://documentation.heliosvoting.org/verification-specs/helios-v4) also provides the basis for 
the implementation of the core methods in this repository responsible for verifying 
the different components of an election.

For some background on the cryptographic primitives used in helios and thus in this verifier see: <br>
